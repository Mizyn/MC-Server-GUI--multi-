Version .2.0
  Rearranged the GUI a little
  Added a save button. (Sends "save-all" to the server)

Version .1.2
  Typing anywhere on the Main Window tab will now automatically grant focus to the console input box while the server is running.
  Pressing CONTROL+S will toggle the Say checkbox.
  If Say is not checked, pressing SHIFT+ENTER will prepend "say " to your text when sending.  If Say IS checked, pressing SHIFT+ENTER will send text WITHOUT prepending "say ".
  Added input history! Press up and down arrows while focused on the console input box and it will cycle through previously sent messages
  Added option to specify how many lines should be saved into the history.
  Added experimental option to completely customize the command line.  This is mostly in here to allow certain mod compatability.  Please let me know how it works!

  Text now scrolls to the end under the following conditions: If the text box has focus or if the mouse is over it.  It will also NOT scroll if you have anything selected within it.
