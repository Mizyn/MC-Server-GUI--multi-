Long wait time for the console output to start showing anything in some cases. (possibly fixed in .3.2)
Custom launch line may not be saving to the config properly. (fixed in .3.2)
Selecting folders to backup with lots of files in them freezes up the gui while it picks up all the file names. (fixed in .3.2)
Start/stop button sometimes becomes unavailable?
All/None buttons a bit too confusing in the scheduler. (maybe less confusing in .3.2?)
Files that were slated to be backed up but are removed/renamed remain in the config. (fixed in .3.2)
